# Transformer-Based-approach-for-hand-gesture-recognition-through-EMG-signals
The project aims at designing and implementing a transformer deep neural network model for classifying hand gestures using electromyogram signals. The model should distinguish several hand gestures where a public EMG dataset will be employed for training and evaluating the proposed model.

# Project Overview

This repository implements a transformer-based approach for data processing and model training. The project is structured to handle multiple datasets (DB2, DB3, DB4), with dedicated directories for data storage, model training, and results visualization.
