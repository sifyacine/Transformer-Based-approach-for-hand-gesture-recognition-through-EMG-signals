# Transformer-Based-approach-for-hand-gesture-recognition-through-EMG-signals
The project aims at designing and implementing a transformer deep neural network model for classifying hand gestures using electromyogram signals. The model should distinguish several hand gestures where a public EMG dataset will be employed for training and evaluating the proposed model.
